I was assigned the Search Engine ask.com. After scrapping the results for the query set 3, the following statistics were calculated: 

Average overlap is 2.27 and overlap percentage is 22.7 with a rho of -10.456285714285716.

Overall ask.com performs worst than the Google search engine. The overlap is only 22.7%, meaning that Ask.com is having a very different approach to ranking pages than Google and same URLs are not given as much importance as Google. The average spearman correlation is negative with a value of -10.456285714285716 meaning that the ranks are negatively correlated.
