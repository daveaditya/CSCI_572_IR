# Homework 01 - Search Comparison

This exercise is about comparing the search results from Google versus different search engines.
Many search engine comparison studies have been done. All of them use samples of data, some
small and some large, so no definitive conclusions can be drawn. But it is always instructive to
see how two search engines match up, even on a small data set.
